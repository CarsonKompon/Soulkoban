# Soulkoban

Soulkoban is a box pushing puzzle game with a very light story. Try to collect all 10 medallions in order to leave the depths and recover your soul. Uncover extra dialogue by talking to NPCs multiple times, revisiting them after new encounters, or even by completing puzzles in a specific order.
